# Tableau-Dashboards
In this assignment two dashbards and stories are created to explore phenomenons using data from the New York Citi Bike Program, the largest bike sharing program in the United States. The assignment intends to refelct a sample of expected generated regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

# Data and Methodology
Data on the Citi Bike Program are collected each month, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. This assignment focuses on two quarter worth of data for year 2018. 
The first quarter reflects data collected during January through March of 2018 and compared to data collected for the fourth quarter which reflects months October through December of 2018. For each quarter one month's worth of data are combined/joined for each respective quarter (eg., January, February, and March = first quarter).
Data are saved and loaded as excel csv files. 

# Major Fidings First Quarter
Findings for the first quarter of 2018 (see Story Dashboard https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/riceanalyticscitibikeassignment/views/Dashboard1/Story1?:iid=12), graphs show location starting points and end points. Of particular interest, lower graphs represent clusters of rider age counts with highest particpant usage which range from 20s - 30s. Starting Station with longest average trip ride is Danforth Light Rail station.  Possible to assess if more stations are needed in and around this area to increase access for more riders. These are the major findings on this dashboard report.

# Major Fidings Fourth Quarter
Findings for the fourth quarter of 2018 (see Story Dashboard https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/riceanalyticscitibikeassignment/views/Dashboard2/Story1?:iid=11), graphs show location starting points and end points. Lower graphs show three clusters of riders by birth year, a change from first quarter from two to three clusters. Starting Station with longest average trip ride is now Bergen Ave; information on Danforth Light Rail station is not available. In comparison to first quarter, ridership has increased for customers and subscribers, reflecting success in the Citi Bike Program is continually growing in popularity.
